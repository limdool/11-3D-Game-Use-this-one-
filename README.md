# E11a-3D
This is the first Godot 3D exercise. Because it is so excellent, I would like you to follow the Godot 101: Intro to 3D tutorial from KidsCanCode.

The hardest part of working with a 3D project in Godot, at least initially, will be learning how to navigate the 3D Viewport. Although I expect you to turn in the results of the the third tutorial video, I would strongly recommend that you watch (and follow along with) all three videos in order.

First, **fork and clone** this repository. Then, open Godot and Import a project. Find the location of this repository in the Godot file picker and then open the project.godot file.

When the time comes, the tutorial will instruct you to download a kit of 3D assets from kenney.nl. Those assets are available here: [https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit). Make sure you download it (or copy it) into your project folder and then unzip it there.

The exercise is to produce the sphere character (with mouse and keyboard controls) that can navigate a simple terrain. The directions to create that should be well-explained in the following videos:

 * [Godot 101: Intro to 3D (part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7soQ-N-eQ)
 * [Godot 101: Intro to 3D (part 2): Importing 3D Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lWro1V0klY)
 * [Godot 101: Intro to 3D (part 3): Kinematic Character Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ickZ_Genr7A)
 
 When you have completed the exercise, save the Scenes, edit your LICENSE and README, commit everything to Github, and turn in the URL of your repository on Canvas.
