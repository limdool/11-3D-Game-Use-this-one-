# 11-3D Game

Today, I built 3D game using Godot. First, I made my own repository and opend it by using Github Desktop. Then, I copied the files from the old assignment, E11a-3D, and pasted them to the repository. I opened Godot and imported the file. Next, I began making new changes, such as adding more blocks. I also referred to the video given on Canvas and announcement. There are the links for the videos:

After making the project, I ran the project to see if there are any errors. Luckily, there were no errors. After that, I opened Github Desktop and commited to master. Finally, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
